            Zettelkasten as a cybernetic system. Combination of disorder and
            order, of lump formation, and unexpected, in ad hoc access realised
            combination. Prerequisite: Abandonment of fixed order. The upstream
            differentiation: Search aids vs content; index, questions,
            [spontaneous] ideas vs what already exists, reshapes and makes in
            part obsolete the inner order that must be assumed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <p>(9/8a)</p>
          <p>
            The productivity problem has to be based on a relation, namely on
            the relation of Zettelkasten and user.
