        Zettelkasten as a cybernetic system. Combination of disorder and order,
        of lump formation, and unexpected, in ad hoc access realised
        combination. Prerequisite: Abandonment of fixed order. The upstream
        differentiation: Search aids vs content; index, questions, [spontaneous]
        ideas vs what already exists, reshapes and makes in part obsolete the
        inner order that must be assumed.
