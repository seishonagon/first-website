          Zettelkasten as a cybernetic system. Combination of disorder and
          order, of lump formation, and unexpected, in ad hoc access realised
          combination. Prerequisite: Abandonment of fixed order. The upstream
          differentiation: Search aids vs content; index, questions,
          [spontaneous] ideas vs what already exists, reshapes and makes in part
          obsolete the inner order that must be assumed.

          The productivity problem has to be based on a relation, namely on the
          relation of Zettelkasten and user.

          The Zettelkasten has grown incessantly, and I have tried, to the best
          of my ability, to profit from it.(1)

          Zettelkasten as a septic tank - don't put just treated notes in.
          Suspending of examination and decision making- also a question of
          speed.

          On the general organisation of memory see Ashby 1967, p103. It is
          therefore important that one is not dependent on a myriad of
          point-by-point accesses, but to be able to rely on relations between
          notes, i.e. on references that make more available at once than one
          has in mind when following a search impulse or fixating on a thought
        </p>

          Because of the previous point it is important that the order in the
          Zettelkasten is not aggregated merely under terms or complex single
          topics; although this is of course also necessary. But the connections
          shouldn’t merely cover the leading points aggregating collective
          terms, but must selectively pull away the material collected under
          them.

          Feedback loop for reading: one reads differently if one is mindful of
          the possibilities of the Zettelkasten process - not: excerpts!

            Possibly, recourse to the concept of information that presupposes
            selection horizons, comparison schemes, etc. which cannot be
            predetermined. Therefore, the Zettelkasten becomes productive as it
            exposes what is noted to what is not noted and thus allows the formation
            of information that was not stored in this way.

          The Zettelkasten Method is based on this experience: One cannot think
          without writing - at least not in demanding contexts that anticipate
          selective access to memory. This also means: without notching
          differences one cannot think.

          Comments on registration of knowledge in the Royal Society in Sprat
          1667, p. 115f. Abandonment of hasty systematization and closure,
          openness to the future: “Nor ought this neglect of consequence and
          order, to be only thought to proceed from their carelessness; but from
          mature and well grounded premeditation.”

          All arbitrary ideas, all coincidences of readings, can be brought in.
          The internal connectivity then decides.

          There is a note in the Zettelkasten that contains the argument that
          refutes the claims on every other note. But this note disappears as
          soon as one opens the Zettelkasten. I.e. it appropriates a different
          number, changes position (or: disguises itself) and is then not to be
          found. A joker.

        Topic: Communication with the Zettelkasten: How to get an adequate

          Personnel has been scarce and expensive for a long time, now it
          additionally becomes unruly and unmanageable. Microprocessors have
          been announced, but are not really available yet. One’s own memory is
          deficient and in need of relief. Considerations on an attempt to
          create a second memory.

          Ghost in the box? Spectators visit. They get to see everything, and
          nothing but that - like in a porn movie. And the disappointment is
          correspondingly high.
